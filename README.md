# Image Card

****

Create an image card using few semantic tags and basic styling. 

## HTML

This project used ***h1, h2, img, section, article, footer, p and a*** tags for HTML.

1. ***h1*** - For the main heading.
2. ***section*** - A container sectioning all cards.
3. ***article*** - A container for each card.
4. ***img*** - Where the image will go.
5. ***h2*** - The semantic tag used for the card heading.
6. ***footer*** - As the name says, it is the section at the foot of the site.
7. ***p*** - A paragraph tag for inserting text.
8. ***a*** - Tag for including an internal/external link. In this case a github account of the developer.

## CSS

Styling the image card using ***box-sizing, background-color, margin, padding, box-shadow, border-radius, font properties, text properties and flex properties.*** Additionally added ***media queries*** to effect different changes on different viewports.

- ***box-sizing*** - This property sets how the total width, height of an element is calculated when adding padding, margin, border and additional height and weight. The **border-box** value adds content, padding and border.
- ***background-color*** - Adding a color to the background of the element/tag. You could use a name, hex, rgb and hsl values to set the desired color.
- ***color*** - Setting a text color.
- ***margin*** - Creating space around an element.
- ***padding*** - Creating space within an element.
- ***width*** - setting the width of the content/element.
- ***font properties*** - **font-weight** (for setting the thickness of the font). **font-size** (setting how small or large the font is). **text-decoration** (setting either the color or lines to the text). **text-align** (alignment of text in relation to horizontal or vertical plane).
- ***border-radius*** - The property that rounds the corners of an element.
- ***box-shadow*** - Adding a drop shadow to the element.
- ***flex properties*** - Designating how an item/element will shrink or grow to fit the available space in a flex container. These include **flex-direction** (for setting either in row or column format) **flex-wrap** (to set whether the content will remain in one line or be "wrapped" into multi-lines), **justify-content** (distributing space between and around an element), **align-items** (aligns items either on the cross-axis or block-axis).
- ***media queries*** - For setting display of content on different divices.
